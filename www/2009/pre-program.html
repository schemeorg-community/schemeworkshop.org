              <h3>Randomized Testing in PLT Redex</h3>
              <p>This paper presents new support for randomized testing in PLT Redex, a
domain-specific language for formalizing operational semantics. In
keeping with the overall spirit of Redex, the testing support is as
lightweight as possible—Redex programmers simply write down
predicates that correspond to facts about their calculus and the tool
randomly generates program expressions in an attempt to falsify the
predicates. Redex's automatic test case generation begins with simple
expressions, but as time passes, it broadens its search to include
increasingly complex expressions. To improve test coverage, test
generation exploits the structure of the model's metafunction and
reduction-relation definitions.</p>
              <p>The paper also reports on a case-study applying Redex's testing
support to the latest revision of the Scheme standard. Despite a
community review period, as well as a comprehensive,
manually-constructed test suite, Redex's random test case generation
was able to identify several bugs in the semantics.</p>

              <h3>A pattern-matcher for alphaKanren -or- How to get into trouble with CPS macros</h3>
              <p>CPS macros written using Scheme's <i>syntax-rules</i> macro system allow for easier 
composition of macros and control over the order of macro expansion. We identify a limitation of CPS macros when used 
to generate bindings from a non-unique list of user-specified identifiers.  Implementing a pattern matcher for the Kanren 
family of relational programming languages revealed this limitation.  Identifiers come from the pattern, and repetition 
indicates that the same variable binding should be used.  Using a CPS macro, binding is delayed until after the comparisons 
are performed.  This may cause free identifiers that are symbolically equal to be conflated, even when they are introduced 
by different parts of the source program.  After expansion, this leaves some identifiers unbound that should be bound.  
In our first solution, we use syntax-case with <i>bound-identifier=?</i> to correctly compare the delayed bindings.  
Our second solution uses eager binding with <i>syntax-rules</i>, which requires abandoning CPS macros when discovering new identifiers.</p>

              <h3>Screen-Replay: A Session Recording and Analysis Tool for DrScheme</h3>
              <p>Approaches to teaching "Introduction to Programming" vary considerably.  However, two broad 
categories may be considered: product oriented vs process oriented. Whereas, in the former the final product is most 
significant, in the latter the process for achieving the final product is also considered very important. Process 
oriented programming courses strive to equip students with good programming habits. In such courses, assessment 
is challenging since it requires the observation of how students develop their programs. Conventional methods 
and tools that assess final products are not adequate for such observation.</p>
              <p>This paper introduces a tool for non-intrusive observation of program development process. 
This tool is designed to support the process oriented approach of "How to Design Programs" (HtDP) and is 
implemented for the DrScheme environment. The design, implementation and utility of this tool is described with examples.</p>

              <h3>Keyword and Optional Arguments in PLT Scheme</h3>
              <p>The 'lambda' and procedure-application forms in PLT Scheme support
arguments that are tagged with keywords, instead of identified by
position, as well as optional arguments with default values. Unlike
previous keyword-argument systems for Scheme, a keyword is not
self-quoting as an expression, and keyword arguments use a different
calling convention than non-keyword arguments. Consequently, a keyword
serves more reliably (e.g., in terms of error reporting) as a
lightweight syntactic delimiter on procedure arguments. Our design
requires no changes to the PLT Scheme core compiler, because 'lambda'
and application forms that support keywords are implemented by macros
over conventional core forms that lack keyword support.</p>

              <h3>The Scribble Reader: An Alternative to S-expressions for Textual Content</h3>
              <p> For decades, S-expressions have been one of the fundamental
 advantages of languages in the Lisp family—a major factor in
 shaping these languages as an ideal platform for symbolic
 computations, including meta-programming and much more.</p>
              <p>As convenient as this minimalist syntax may be, it is highly
 inconvenient for dealing with textual content.  In this paper we
 describe the reader used by Scribble—the PLT Scheme
 documentation system.  The reader implements a syntax that is easy
 to use, uniform and meshes well with the Scheme philosophy.  The
 syntax makes "here-strings" and string interpolation easy, yet it is
 more powerful than a combination of the two.</p>
