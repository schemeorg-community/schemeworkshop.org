Tabled execution is a generalization of memoization developed by the
logic programming community.  It not only saves results from tabled
predicates, but also stores the set of currently active calls to them;
tabled execution can thus provide meaningful semantics for programs
that seemingly contain infinite recursions with the same arguments.
In logic programming, tabled execution is used for many purposes, both
for improving the efficiency of programs, and making tasks simpler and
more direct to express than with normal logic programs.  However,
tabled execution is only infrequently applied in mainstream functional
languages such as Scheme.  We demonstrate an elegant implementation of
tabled execution in Scheme, using a mix of continuation-passing style
and mutable data.  We also show the use of tabled execution in Scheme
for a problem in formal language and automata theory, demonstrating
that tabled execution can be a valuable tool for Scheme users.
