      Programs in high-level, garbage-collected programming languages
      often need to access libraries that are written in other programming
      languages.  A foreign-function interface provides a high-level
      language with access to low-level programming languages and
      negotiates between the inside and the outside world by taking care
      of the low-level details.  In this paper, I provide an overview of
      what different kinds of foreign-function interfaces are in use in
      today's implementations of functional programming languages to help
      decide on the design of a new foreign-function interface for
      Scheme 48.  Therefore, I revise several mechanisms and design ideas
      and compare them on usability, portability, memory consumption and
      thread safety.  I discuss the garbage-collection related parts of
      foreign-function interfaces using Scheme as the high-level
      functional language and C as the external language.
