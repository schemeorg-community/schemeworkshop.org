      Interaction with embedded systems is usually achieved by hooking up
      these devices to a computer network. The TCP/IP stack of protocols has
      often been used to this end, requiring compact stacks to be
      implemented as regular ones are unsuitable for this use because of
      their large size. Traditionally, compact stacks such as uIP have been
      implemented in C. Here we report on our experience in implementing
      Small Scheme Stack (S3, for short), a compact TCP/IP stack written in
      Scheme for microcontrollers with a few kilobytes of memory. This paper
      describes how we were able to minimize the code size and memory
      requirements by taking advantage of Scheme's power of abstraction and
      of a virtual machine; we also provide a sample application for
      demonstration purposes.
