Call for Papers
</h1>

<p>
The 2008 Workshop on Scheme and Functional Programming provides
an opportunity to report experience with the programming languages
known as Scheme, to discuss ideas for the future of Scheme, and
to present research related to Scheme and functional programming.
We encourage everyone interested in Scheme to participate.
</p>

<p>
This workshop is associated with and will be held two days before
the opening of the
<a href="http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2008/">
2008 International Conference on Functional
Programming</a>
(ICFP), which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN.
</p>

<p>
We invite authors to submit papers in either of two categories:
technical papers and experience papers.
</p>

<p>
Authors of both technical and experience papers are invited
to describe, in an appendix, proposals for demonstrating their
work or ideas during the workshop.
</p>

<p>
We also invite proposals for panel discussions on topics of
interest to the Scheme community.  The author(s) of an accepted
proposal for panel discussion will give a brief introduction
to the topic before moderating the discussion that follows.
</p>

<p>
Submissions are due on <strong>Sunday, 29 June</strong>.
(This extends the original date by nine days.)
Authors will be notified of the program committee's decision
by 14 July.
The final versions of accepted papers will be due on 15 August.
</p>

<blockquote class="darker">
<p>
Publication of a paper at this workshop is not intended
to replace conference or journal publication, and does not
preclude republication of a more complete or finished version
of the paper at some later conference or in a journal.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
Technical papers
</h2>

<p>
Topics of interest for technical papers include (but are not limited to):
</p>
<div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
    Portability and interoperability:
    </strong>
    Issues, solutions, libraries, surveys, standards, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
    Design:
    </strong>
    Language critiques and extensions, concurrent and distributed
    computing, texts, records, objects, modules, macros, types, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
    Implementation:
    </strong>
    Compilers, interpreters, runtime systems, profilers,
    debuggers, programming environments, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
    Theory:
    </strong>
    Semantics, memory models, concurrency, correctness of
    analyses, transformations, and programs, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
    Education:
    </strong>
    Teaching functional programming, teaching with Scheme, etc.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<hr/>

<h2>
Experience papers
</h2>

<p>
Topics of interest for experience papers include (but are not limited to):
</p>

<div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
    Applications:
    </strong>
    Interesting uses of Scheme in commercial or real-world contexts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
    Practice and experience:
    </strong>
    Experience with Scheme in education
    and industry, especially experience that identifies things
    Scheme does well or poorly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
    Scheme pearls:
    </strong>
    Short papers that describe elegant and enlightening uses of Scheme.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Experience papers need not report original research results;
they may instead report experience that will benefit others,
such as elegant or realistic solutions to practical problems.
The key criterion for such a paper is that it helps other
practitioners.  It is not enough simply to describe a program!

Submission guidelines
</h2>

<div>
<ul>
  <li>
    Submissions should be sent to the
    <a href="mailto:will+submission@ccs.neu.edu">program chair</a>
    as a PDF or Postscript file suitable for printing on US Letter
    sized paper.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submissions should be no longer than 12 pages,
    including bibliography and appendices.
    Authors who wish to furnish the program committee
    with additional materials in support of the paper
    may do so in clearly marked appendices.
    These appendices will not be counted as part of
    the submission, will not be counted against the
    12-page limit, and may not even be read by any
    members of the program committee.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submissions should be prepared in standard ACM format: two columns,
    nine point font on ten point baseline, page 20pc (3.33in) wide and
    54pc (9in) tall with a column gutter of 2pc (0.33in).
  </li>
  <li>
    A suggested LaTex
    <a href="http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2008/sigplanconf.cls">
    class file</a> is provided,
    with accompanying
    <a href="http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2008/sigplanconf-guide.pdf">
    guide</a>,
    <a href="http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2008/sigplanconf-template.tex">
    template</a>,
    and
    <a href="http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2008/retrospective.tex">
    example
    </a>
    including
    <a href="http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2008/retrospective.bbl">
    references.
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Submitted papers must have content that has not previously been
    published in other conferences or refereed venues, and simultaneous
    submission to other conferences or refereed venues is unacceptable.
  </li>
  <li>
    We recommend (but do not require) that citations be put into
    author-date form.  For details on how to do this, see the
    <a href="http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2008/cfp/cfp.html#citations">
