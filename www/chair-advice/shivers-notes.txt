Notes on running the Scheme Workshop				-*- outline -*-
Olin Shivers
2002/10/9

(Emacs should display this document in outline mode. Say c-h m for
instructions on how to move through it by sections (e.g., c-c c-n, c-c c-p).)

I was the chairman for the Third Workshop on Scheme and Functional Programming
(aka "Scheme 2002"), which was held in Pittsburgh on 2002/10/3. Although I had
served on the program committees of several conferences, Scheme 2002 was my
first experience actually running the whole show.

This note is a somewhat rambling attempt to write down everything I learned
from the experience, for the benefit of those who might get the job in the
future. A lot of the things I'll say are sort of generally known -- learned by
the osmotic process of watching others do things. In fact, if you haven't
already been on enough program committees to have soaked up most of this stuff
by observation, you probably shouldn't be running a workshop. But I'm going to
go ahead and write some of them down to spell it all out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* How to use these notes
------------------------

Sharing the load is not the only reason workshop responsibility is rotated --
each different organiser brings something new to the event, and this keeps
things fresh. So the point of these notes is not to set in concrete the form &
function of a workshop. It's to equip you with lookahead and pre-packaged
procedures to handle the particulars *in order* to free you up to inject your
own ideas into the workshop. If you are wrestling with PostScript hacking or
tripping over a deadline, you don't have cycles free to innovate. Don't
reinvent the wheel -- use my design and move on to the turbocharger.

So...
  - slavishly follow all the items described below that fit your needs
    exactly -- have no compunction about indulging in outright theft;
  - tweak the things that are roughly appropriate;
  - boldly innovate where you have ideas of your own.

In this way, it's just like research.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* One-year time line
--------------------
It goes like this:
  - First you set the critical dates, assemble a program committee,
    pick a guy to run the web server.
  - Then you set up a web page.
  - Then you write a Request for Workshop Proposal and get your workshop
    approved by the sponsoring conference. You mention your PC & web url
    in your RFW to show you have your act together.
  - Your parent conference approves your RFW.
  - then you write a call-for-papers and (after iterating over it with your
    steering committee) web-publish-it/netnews-post-it/email-it-around.
  - then you try to think of invited speakers, etc. (if you want them),
  - and send the mini-TRMF budget paperwork (just one, easy page) to ACM.
  - Then you remind people of the approaching paper-submission deadline.
  - and start the personal lobbying to get people to submit papers,
    at T-4weeks or T-6weeks.
  - Submission-deadline day: get the papers. Make *sure* your web-server
    acolyte is camped out by the web server tending its needs on this day.
  - Deal the papers out to the PC.
  - Cheerfully hound them into reviewing the papers. 
    (And do your own reviewing.)
  - Checkpoint: given what you've got, in the way of papers, does the workshop
    look like you have enough quality material to fly? Or should you shut it
    down? Or perhaps you can wildly reconfigure it to be more of a 
    town-meeting, less of a presentation-of-research-papers? Or maybe you can
    pull out of a disaster by commissioning some great invited talks from 
    serious players? Now is when you decide: green-light/red-light. In the
    event of a disaster, you will be consulting/discussing all this with
    the steering & program committees.
  - Have the PC meeting, virtually or face-to-face.
  - Discuss possible invited speakers/panel sessions/etc. with PC and 
    pin this all down.
  - Notify the authors.
  - Set the workshop schedule & web publish it.
  - Another round of publicity, now that you know the content of the workshop.
  - Final-version papers come in from authors. Check them over; deal with
    problems.
  - Get the proceedings assembled -- hardcopy & a web version.
  - Run the workshop.
  - Make the online proceedings available on the web.
  - Meet with the steering committee and review/debrief. How'd it go?
    What to do next year? Skip a year? Colocate w/a different conference?
    Shut it down? Build it up? Build it up, how? Pick the person who's in 
    charge for next year.
  - Meta-work: write a document like this one for next year's guy. What'd
    you learn that's not in this document? What ideas did you have that
    worked out really well? What did you trip over? Institutionalise the 
    knowledge. Get the attendance & paper-submission stats and record them 
    someplace useful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Tech report or ACM publication?
---------------------------------
There are two standard things you can do to publish the proceedings for
the workshop. (1) ACM will do it for you, or (2) you can put them out as
a tech-report from your local institution (e.g., the Georgia Tech College
of Computing, in my case).

** ACM does it
==============
If ACM does it, things are pretty easy. You just ship them the papers
by a certain deadline, which the parent conference's workshop chair will
set, and the proceedings are created. They will look nice -- real covers,
nice binding. They will sit on people's shelves for years without falling 
apart.

However, ACM will require that all the authors sign over the copyrights to the
papers. If you want a different copyright (I did), then you will need to
switch to an alternate route. (See below for the issues involved.)

** You do it as a TR
====================

If you put the proceedings out as a tech report from your local institution,
then you have to do whatever work is required at your local institution to
make that happen. One advantage of this might be your ability to choose a
different copyright policy. (See below.)

If you do this, you are also responsible for making sure a bunch of copies
are produced and shipped up to the workshop in time for the actual event.
You'll need to make sure to produce enough -- enough to cover the attendees
that pre-register, plus extras to handle late registrants *and* people who
might be attending co-located workshops or conferences that might want to
buy a copy, even though they are not registered for the workshop itself.

By way of example, Scheme 2002 had 34 pre-registrants. I had 50 copies printed
up. The actual head count was over 40; all fifty were snapped up by the end
of the co-located PLI conference. Fifty copies are heavy and expensive to
ship. Sitting in Atlanta, I had them printed and bound at a Kinko's in
Pittsburgh... and then, being paranoid, I arranged for a friendly grad
student at CMU to go by the Kinko's and check over the documents to make
sure no pages had been left out, or done upside down, etc. And I did this
with enough lead time so that had something gone wrong, we could have shifted
into panic mode and handled it. When the registrants arrive for the workshop,
the proceedings have to be there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Copyrights & the "archival publication" issue
-----------------------------------------------

The standard rule in the academic paper game is that you can submit a paper to
a conference or a journal only if you haven't published it somewhere else.
Workshops, however, are a grey area. Some workshops are effectively little
specialist, high-quality conferences; people cite papers from their
proceedings. Some workshops, on the other hand, have more of a "snapshot of
current progress" nature -- people present raw, possibly not-ready-for-
archival-publication research to their colleagues to get early exposure and
feedback. Thus the papers represent more of a "stake in the ground," than the
author's final say on the work. The expectation is that the work will
subsequently be polished, extended and sent off to a larger conference or a
journal. In this case, you do *not* want the proceedings to "count" as "prior
publication;" they are, again, in a kind of grey area -- proto-published.

This matters to authors. In the pub-counting game that department heads do
when considering promotion & tenure, publication in a major conference or
journal counts for more than publication in a workshop. So authors won't
submit work to your workshop if this means they will be barred from sending a
later, more mature, revision out to a conference. If you want this kind of
work to be sent to your workshop, you need to set things up so that this
barrier is not in place.

I handled this in two ways:
- I released the proceedings as a tech report. TR's are not generally
  considered to "count" as prior publication from the viewpoint of
  major conferences and journals.
  - Hence a (presumably revised) paper can be re-submitted to an
    "archival" conference or journal;
  - but if a paper never goes any further... it is at least available
    from Georgia Tech. More importantly, Georgia Tech College of Computing
    TR's, like tech reports everywhere, are available from the CoC's home
    page. So people can download them or cite them if the paper is important 
    and a better alternative never happens.

- By releasing the proceedings as a tech report, I was able to choose my own
  copyright conditions. Thus I could allow the authors to *retain copyright*
  to their papers, so they could subsequently re-submit them elsewhere, or
  net-publish them in other, informal ways. I did, however, require authors to
  attach the following copyright notice to the version that appeared in the
  workshop proceedings, a version of the ACM copyright that I broadened to
  allow general non-commercial reproduction of the work:

    Permission to make digital or hard copies, to republish, to post on
    servers or to redistribute to lists all or part of this work is granted
    without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or
    commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full
    citation on the first page. To otherwise copy or redistribute requires
    prior specific permission. Third Workshop on Scheme and Functional
    Programming. October 3, 2002, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Copyright
    2002 <author's-name-here>.

Again, if ACM publishes the proceedings, *they* will own copyright to the 
papers, with the following (as of 2002/10) copyright:
    Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for
    personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are
    not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies
    bear this notice and the full citation on the first page. To copy
    otherwise, to republish, to post on servers or to redistribute to lists,
    requires prior specific permission and/or a fee.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Document production
---------------------
There's more to do if you produce your own proceedings instead of letting
the ACM do it for you. I did my own, so I have a bunch of stuff to say on
this topic.

** Document style
=================
I really hate the new ACM style -- the section headings are jarringly large
(the entire heading is upper-cased). If I were doing it over again, I would
hack the ACM official LaTeX class file to return to the smaller, quieter,
sans-serif section heads that ACM conferences used to use.

** Errors
=========
People will send you their documents, probably in PostScript or PDF format.
Right off the bat, you should preview them and make sure they're in the right
page layout -- if you plan to issue proceedings on 8.5"x11" American "letter"
paper, you can probably count on a couple of Europeans to send you papers
typeset for A4 paper. Or vice-versa -- if the the proceedings are to be
printed on A4 paper, the Americans will all accidentally give you documents
typeset for 8.5"x11". Even if people are thinking about it, and trying to be
careful, they will still mess it up. The reason is that the classic LaTeX
tool chain has multiple points where things can go wrong -- where the author's
local system defaults can take over and do the wrong thing. Even though,
for example, the ACM LaTeX class file
    acm_proc_article-sp.cls
fixes the page size to 8.5"x11", the dvips or dvipdfm programs can take the 
dvi file and produce PS or PDF files that are A4, if that's what the local
defaults are. Authors can override this on a Unix system with
    dvips -t letter ...
    dvips -t a4 ...
    dvipdfm -p letter ...
    dvipdfm -p a4 ...
as needed. (I recommend not using dvipdf -- the pdf files it produces must
cause poor font hinting or something, because they look awful when previewed. 
Dvipdfm works much better.) Most people don't know about these switches, so
the ones on the wrong side of the Atlantic get the local default and things
come out wrong.

On a Unix system, you can check the papers by previewing them with acroread
or gv. Gv will say at the top of the window, and acroread will say at the
bottom, what size it thinks the pages are. Check immediately, and iterate
with the author if it's wrong.

I iterated with one European author for two weeks and possibly fifteen
submissions before he sent me a properly typeset 8.5"x11" paper. He just kept
discovering new places in his tool chain where things had gone wrong... and he
didn't have an American laser printer on hand for a real end-to-end test.

If you warn authors in your "final instructions" mailout to attend to these
things carefully, and tell them about the right options to the tools and how
to check with acroread or gv, you will probably not have to deal with quite so
much lossage as I did. You might also warn authors that when they change
page-sizes, their line breaks will change, and they should be careful to
visually check their papers to make sure everything is copacetic. This is
all obvious, of course! Doesn't matter. People will still get it wrong.

** Page numbering & document merging
====================================
Say you have nine papers. You want to assign the pages of each document
page numbers such that they will be "globally" numbered -- the first
paper will get, say, page-numbers 1 through 9, the second paper will be
assigned page numbers 10 through 22, and so forth. But your authors are
sending you PostScript or PDF files (without page numbers). How do you
"stick" page numbers onto pages in a PS file?

I wrote Scheme code to scan through a PostScript document and, at each
page boundary, deposit a little chunk of PostScript code to print out
a page number. This allowed me to number the PS files myself. A related
trick allowed me to optionally add a little chunk of PostScript to output
a blank, numbered page if a particular document ended on an odd page number,
thus ensuring that each paper in the proceedings began on a 
right-side/odd-numbered page when printed out two-sided.

Now you have a collection of distinct PostScript files, each one a properly
page-numbered paper. You also presumably have a separate PostScript file for
the front matter: title page, preface, table of contents. You would like to
take all of these files and somehow glue them together to make one big
PostScript file -- this makes it easier to have your document turned into
hardcopy by a production shop like Kinko's, and it gives you the ability to
post a single file on the net as the proceedings. How do you do this?

There's a Unix tool (a perl script) called psmerge that purports to do exactly
this. But it does not appear to work. It doesn't even seem to be finished code.
I wrote Scheme code to directly disassemble & reassemble the PS files myself, 
but lacked enough information about PostScript document formats to make this
approach work. So here is what I did:
  - I concatenated all the individual PostScript files together, and
    fed the result to distill -- the Adobe ps->pdf distiller tool. This
    actually works, producing a pdf file for the whole proceedings.
      cat *.ps | distill -compatlevel 3.0 -resolution 2400 \
                         -embedallfonts on -colordownsample off
    The resolution and colorsampling switches keep included figures
    at a high spatial & color resolution. Note that distiller is a commercial
    product, so you have to find a host that has a properly licensed (i.e., 
    paid for) copy.

  - Then I used Adobe acrobat to move back from pdf to ps.
      acroread -toPostScript -fast -level2 -printerhalftones \
               -size letter foo.pdf

There are probably other ways to do this. One sign that this approach is not
all it could be is that the final PostScript file (produced, you will note, by
a pair of Adobe products), will cause Adobe distiller to lock up and go into
an infinite loop. Hmm.

Access to a library allowing parsing and manipulation of PDF documents might
be a better way to go. Or you could handle the page-numbering task by asking
your authors to iterate with you a final time, once you know the proper
starting page number for each paper.

** Front matter
===============
The "front matter" of a document is the title page, preface, table of
contents, etc. that precede the actual body of the document. Feel free
to base yours on the LaTeX I used. (See references at the end of this
document.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Email heartbeats
------------------
It's good to maintain an email "heartbeat" during the workshop planning
process -- when you are busy processing things, send an update to the steering
committee, the program committee or the accepted-authors list. If you maintain
mailing lists for these three sets of people, it is trivial to send a
three-line msg out to the appropriate list when needed. People will rest
easier knowing issues have been registered and are being handled, even if the
solution is not totally nailed down.

I did *not* do this when I ran Scheme 2002; I stayed silent until I had a
resolution on an issue, and this induced unnecessary worry in the in-between
spaces.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Delegate
----------
You should arrange to have someone in charge of publicity and someone in
charge of the necessary network services -- i.e. running the web page
& mailing lists. The web-page job, in particular, is critical. 
- You will need a home page for your workshop so that people can check on
  it during the one-year run-up to the event.
- The home page will also be the standard location where people look up
  the call-for-papers, the relevant deadlines, and the selected list of
  papers.
- You'll need a page allowing authors to submit papers off the net.
- You'll need infrastructure to support the reviewing process -- your
  program committee will need to download the papers, upload reviews,
  look at the other reviews, etc., all under some kind of authentication
  system to protect access to the reviews. There are software systems
  that do exactly this. For Scheme 2002, the workshop web maintainer just
  wrote Scheme web-server code on the fly to meet the committee's needs.
- You'll need to mail out notifications of acceptance and rejection once
  the reviewing process is finished.

The point of having someone manage all this is that you, personally, are going
to be very tied down making decisions, managing the group-decision review
process, and so forth. If you can *implement* a decision simply by sending an
email msg to someone who then does the appropriate the web-server hackery, you
can get on to the next decision with something like reasonable speed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Running the paper-selection process
-------------------------------------
Before you select your program committee, you need to nail down the dates
during which the members are expected to read the papers, and when the actual
program-selection meeting will happen (virtually or face-to-face). These dates
must be part of the invitation to join the committee -- members must be
available during those windows of time. If someone is, for example, getting 
married during that time, you have a problem.

A face-to-face meeting, where everyone comes together for 1-2 days of
full-time, no-interruption discussion is the *best* way to select papers. This
is probably unrealistic for a small workshop, unless you can "piggyback" on
some other magnet event that everyone else will be attending anyway, such as a
major conference. More likely, however, you'll have to do it via email.

For a small workshop, I had everyone send me reviews, formatted as
seven-element Scheme lists for easy processing. (Or have folks enter them
using a web service you set up.) During the review-submission phase, it's good
if you have some web-viewable scoreboard that indicates which reviews are
submitted and which are outstanding, without releasing the actual text or
rating of the reviews. This serves as a intra-committee shaming mechanism to
encourage lazy reviewers (such as myself) to get their asses in gear as the
meeting deadline approaches. The initial reviews, as encoded in the
seven-element list, have a rating field which provides very coarse resolution:
"definitely no," "definitely yes," or "discuss." This simple rating (which I
stole from Matthias Felleisen) would not suffice for a large conference, but
is fine a small workshop. When the virtual/email meeting starts, you first
quickly take care of the yes/no papers on which there is wide agreement, then
you have the rest of your time for the "discuss" papers, or papers on which
there is wide variance.

There are a selection of web-based systems now becoming available for
automatic the review process. You should almost certainly investigate
and use one of these.

Program committee members frequently ask outside experts to review papers
about which they don't feel that knowledgeable. I have stolen a ruling from
Simon Peyton-Jones here: a pc member can get an outside review, but *must*, in
any event, read the paper and write a review himself. Without this
requirement, the committee member really can't join the discussion -- even if
the paper completely baffles him, his effort to read it and write a review is
what will allow him to actually *apply* his outside expert's review. You
should make this contract clear as a condition of membership when you recruit
your program committee.

In my view, my job as committee chairman is to mostly listen. If you are busy
telling the program committee whether or not to accept a paper, why did you
have a program committee in the first place? It is helpful, during the
discussion, for the chairman to send out summaries -- global context to guide
local decision making. I.e., a little table showing the papers selected,
rejected, and currently-undetermined, along with a tally of how many free
slots are left. This allows relative judgements to be made, especially after
you've processed most of the papers and get down to the last few papers (where
you'll spend most of your time and heat). As things take shape, you can
restate decision-requests in this framework, i.e. "We can only accept two more
papers. Accepting paper X means rejecting one of Y & Z. Does it meet that
level?" It is also helpful, after a round of discussion, to summarise and
"play back" what you have heard -- i.e., "What I am hearing is that people are
generally uneasy about the lack of X Y & Z in this paper but no one has quite
exceeded threshold to say 'kill it.' No one seems willing to champion the
paper. Unless someone stands up and gets passionate about it, I think we
should kill it and move on." This forces people to gauge their commitment to a
given paper, and you can move forward.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The mini-tmrf
---------------
ACM gets a handle on your workshop by some document called a "mini TMRF"
(ACM-speak for "technical-meeting request form"). It basically states
the parent conference/location/date, expected number of attendees, and some
rough budget information (fixed costs, like meeting-room cost & printing up
the proceedings, and per-capita costs, like lunch). It takes about five
minutes to fill out, if you have access to last year's mini-TMRF -- you just
start with last year's numbers and adjust them up or down as you think proper.

ACM mailed me the mini-TMRF-request as a Microsoft Word attachment, which I
was then supposed to fill in and mail back. Give me a break; it's 49 lines of
simple text. Here is what it looks like. When you get yours, turn it around and
ship it back immediately. This will serve to stun and amaze the beset-upon
administrators struggling to make your parent conference happen.

    International Conference on Principles and Practice of Declarative
    Programming), will be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 4-8, 2002.

    Affiliated workshops will be scheduled from October 3-8.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Getting the word out
----------------------

You will, of course, write up a call for papers, and it will have all the
important dates and list all the interesting PC members whose association with
your workshop will cause the research community to sit up and take notice. And
you will post your CFP on your workshop's home page and ship it to all the
right netnews groups and mailing lists. But.

CFPs are long documents. People blast through their email. They may skip over
the CFP, expect to come back to it later... and then it just falls off the end
of their queue. You just lost a potential paper.

So when you post to a newsgroup or spam a set of mailing lists, *write a
personal, friendly, short intro that gets the important bits out:*
  - the workshop is happening, 
  - it'll be in October, colocated with ICFP, 
  - and the SUBMISSIONS DEADLINE IS IN SIX WEEKS. 
Those are the key items you want people to know. Here is what I wrote when I 
posted to netnews:

    From: Olin Shivers (shivers@cc.gatech.edu)
    Subject: The SIGPLAN Scheme Workshop

    The 2002 Scheme Workshop will be in Pittsburgh in October, the day
    before ICFP. Submission deadline for papers is May 17. We will be
    planning not only presentation of papers but also some interesting
    group discussions. Going by the previous workshops, it should be a
    useful and fun day for just about anyone with an interest in Scheme
    or functional programming languages. I hope to see you there, and I
    especially encourage people to submit papers to the program committee.
    Please take a moment to read the "call for papers" I've appended below, 
    and see if you have a topic or result you would like to submit to the
    program committee.

    See you in Pittsburgh.
	-Olin Shivers

I posted the CFP for Scheme 2002 to the comp.lang.scheme netnews group, and a
separate post to these somewhat-related newsgroups

  comp.lang.dylan, comp.lang.functional, comp.lang.lisp, comp.lang.lisp.franz,
  comp.lang.lisp.mcl, comp.lang.lisp.x, comp.lang.apl, comp.lang.clos

with a prefatory piece of text explaining the cross-post:

    The Scheme Workshop will be held this year in Pittsburgh, in October, the
    day before ICFP. I am the workshop chairman. I am taking the liberty of
    cross-posting the call for papers to some netnews programming-language
    groups with related topics. We would certainly welcome papers on relevant
    topics from your communities as well as attendance and participation in
    the workshop's discussions.

* Money
-------

You might want to try to come up with a list of researchers or other
interested parties who work at companies with either a direct interest in your
workshop area, or general interest and deep pockets. See if they can get you
some sponsorship -- a 5-10k$ grant, perhaps. It is not a bad idea to have a
specific budget in mind, or a specific use & target sum when you approach a
company, as opposed to a diffuse lay-some-money-on-us request. You can, for
example, use the money to grant travel support to interested but impoverished
grad students. If you do this, of course, good manners and a sense of
obligation should impel you to place corporate-sponsorship logos on your web
page, in the preface of the conference proceedings, and inside your CFP. And
you should definitely mention the availability of travel support for needy
cases on your web page, in your CFP and any subsequent call-for-participation
you issue.

But you don't want to let a company "buy" your workshop. (It's not likely
they'd want to, but erroneously giving the impression they have done so is
just as damaging.) So if you, for example, ask Todd Proebsting or Charles
Simonyi from Microsoft to come and give an exciting, *invited* talk... you
probably don't want to ask Microsoft to sponsor your workshop. (If Charles
submits a paper to the *reviewed* paper track, there's no conflict.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Talk preparation
------------------
Small workshops are sometimes the first presentation young grad students
make; they are also sometimes a venue for passionately interested people
who are not mainstream academics to present work. If so, you may get some
interesting submissions from people who haven't been carefully trained to make
public presentations of research papers, and so their actual talk may bomb.
I specifically addressed this in my "final instructions" mail to the authors
presenting work at Scheme 2002; feel free to steal my text if you like.

Some conferences follow the practice of assigning "shepherds" to accepted
papers to help with requested (or perhaps required) revisions. I have assigned
a shepherd once to help out an inexperienced author who had presented a great
result in a very awkward manner. The author was very grateful for the
assistance, and, in my opinion, it transformed his talk and slides from a
probable disaster into a definite success. This is an item you can pull out
of your toolbox during the review session, but it's a tricky thing to do,
and probably only warranted in exotic cases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Personal leverage
-------------------

If you didn't know a bunch of people in your little research area, you
wouldn't have been chosen to run your workshop. This applies to your
workshop's steering committee and program committee, as well. All told, this
is a group of 10 or 15 people who, in turn, know hundreds of people in your
workshop's area of interest. When you are a 1-2 months from the submission
deadline, get to work, and put these people to work, too. Be persistent. Call
people up and harangue them to submit something interesting to the workshop.
You know who these people are. You know who is doing cool stuff. You know
who probably has grad students developing good things that could use an
early airing within the active community pushing on related issues.

Do you know the PC chairman for a related conference that recently sent out
notifications of acceptance & rejection? (Answer: yes, because you set up your
submission deadlines this way on purpose. You contacted these people early to
find out these dates when they were being formed.) This chairman cannot
violate authors' privacy and tell you who had papers rejected that might, with
another round of revision, be suitable for your workshop... but the
information can flow in the *other direction* with no ethical lapses -- you can
ask this PC chairman to pass word to the appropriate (in his judgement)
authors about the opportunity your impending workshop submission deadline
represents.

Does all this sound like a hassle? It turns out to be an extremely useful
thing to do. In the case of Scheme 2002, personal recruiting on the part of
several PC members flushed several high-quality papers out of hiding and into
the review funnel -- papers that *would not otherwise have been submitted*. I
know of two other papers we *should* have gotten... but we leaned on the
authors too late, and, though interested and willing, they did not have time
to get their paper ready.

Of course, you and the other paper-rustlers must be clear that you can't
promise anything except that the paper will receive exactly the same careful
review and consideration that all the other papers will get. These aren't
invited papers you are soliciting -- they are submitted to the selection
process. Be careful that you don't appear to be promising anything else.

Note that there are some who disapprove of this technique. If you solicit a
paper, and then bounce it, authors may have their feelings bruised. It always
hurts to have a paper bounced, and this twists the knife a bit. Submitting a
paper to a conference has an opportunity cost, as well: it ties up the the
paper for several months, during which time the author can't submit it to some
other venue -- some other possibly more appropriate venue. So pressuring
someone into premature or inappropriate submission could also cause hurt
feelings.

I still think this is a good tactic... but be aware of the issues involved.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Have a guy to talk to
-----------------------
The whole steering committee is there to help you. Talk to them; email them.
But you might want to pick *one* particular guy as a sounding board. Phone
calls play a role in this that email doesn't. People are always jammed up on
their email; it takes time and is work to compose a good reply to a msg. But
phone calls are easy; if you just want to kick a topic around, consider a
phone call. Note, also, that if sensitive issues need to be discussed, phone
calls have the liberating benefit of not leaving an audit trail -- there's no
danger that a frank discussion about, for example, a sensitive human issue
can be accidentally broadcast because you accidentally hit the "reply" key in
your mail system and shipped it off to comp.lang.functional.
