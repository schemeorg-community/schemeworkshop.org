Subject: Notes on chairing the Scheme workshop


If you're going to chair a Scheme workshop ...
==============================================
Mike Sperber, September 28, 2005

- Find out who the ICFP workshop organizers are and when the
  *deadline for workshop proposals* is.  Get cracking before that
  deadline.

- Write up a CFP.  Either copy one from the past (but then make sure
  you approve of it) or write a new one.  Submit it before the
  deadline.

- Put together a PC.  Bigger isn't better---six (including the
  chair(s)) has proven sufficient.

- Find out the various deadlines from the workshop organizers.  Ask
  them for it if they don't send it to you on their own initiative.

- Consider possible publication or non-publication venues, such as
  tech reports at some university, LNCS or FIXME EATCS.  If you want
  to do LNCS, start the negotiations with them *as early as possible*.

- Make up a timeline leading up to the conference, listing submission
  deadline, notification deadline, final paper deadline, and the
  workshop date itself.  Communicate those deadlines to the workshop
  organizers.  More on deadline issues below.

- Set up a website with all the relevant information.  Look at the
  homepages of previous workshops for samples.

- Send out the CFP early.  If at all possible, *before the Haskell
  people do*.  Here's a suggestion for an email header listing the
  most important addresses you might send it to:

Newsgroups: comp.lang.scheme, comp.lang.functional, comp.lang.lisp
Followup-To: comp.lang.scheme
To: rrrs-authors@martigny.ai.mit.edu, scheme-48@s48.org,
 bigloo@sophia.inria.fr, kawa@sources.redhat.com,
 plt-scheme@list.cs.brown.edu, stk@kaolin.unice.fr,
 chicken-users@nongnu.org, scsh-users@scsh.net,
 sisc-users@lists.sourceforge.net, jscheme-user@lists.sourceforge.net,
 schematics-users@lists.sourceforge.net, guile-user@gnu.org,
 rscheme@rscheme.org, ll-discuss@lists.csail.mit.edu

  (You might get back some moderation bounces---follow up on them if
  necessary.)

- Send out 2nd, 3rd CFPs periodically, every 2-4 weeks leading up to
  the submission deadlines.

- Expect to accept most papers if you want to fill the day with
  presentations.  Consider soliciting papers you've long wanted to
  see.  A good source are the SRFIs, and there's still a supply of
  SRFIs whose design story would make a good paper.

- Expect submissions from people new at writing papers, and without a
  CS department that could help them write well.  Consider shepherding
  those papers to make them better.

- If you don't expect a large crowd, print the proceedings locally (or
  xerox them at your employer) and bring them with you on the plane.
  Check in advance how long printing and binding will take.  Expect
  that you'll need twice as many proceedings as you expect
  participants.  (2005 required 44 copies of the proceedings.)  If you
  use the conference arrangements (usually through Sheridan printing)
  make sure you find out the deadlines---but going through them will
  probably cost you four weeks or more that you'll have to factor into
  the scheduling of the deadlines.

- VERY IMPORTANT: When dealing with the PC, make sure you spell out
  all the deadlines clearly as early as possible, and remind them of
  deadlines frequently.  Make the deadlines a few days earlier than
  what you actually need.

- For all important email communication (i.e., most of it), *require
  confirmation*.  (This point can't be overemphasized.)

- Because of the unreliability of email communication, consider using
  Shriram's conference management system if he'll let you.

- Set up your typesetting infrastructure early.  Create a dummy test
  proceedings early with one or two dummy papers.  Find out what kind
  of software the previous chair used to put together the PostScripts
  or PDF files into the proceedings.  Consider requiring people to
  send in LaTeX source, at least for the final submission, as putting
  together PostScript files from different sources can cause trouble
  with fonts.

- Before publishing the program, check with the conference organizers
  about constraints about scheduling, coffee breaks, and so on.
