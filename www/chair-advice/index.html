<h2>Notes on Running a Scheme Workshop</h2>
<ul>
<li> Olin Shivers and Michael Sperber both wrote up thoughts after their
<a href="shivers-notes.txt">respective</a>
<a href="sperber-notes.txt">stints</a> as program chairs.
</li>
<li> The proceedings of the Scheme Workshop has, so far,
been published as a technical report, typically at the
program chair's host institution. This means that authors
can feel free to submit to the Scheme workshop without
worrying that a publication here precludes publication in
another venue.
</li>
<li> Here is some <a href="historical-data.txt">historical
data</a> showing the number of submissions, attendees, etc
from past years.
</li>
<li> Feel free to experiment with any features of the
meeting that you think might make attendance more enjoyable:
shorter talks, longer talks, panel sessions, demo sessions,
invited speakers, gelato, etc.
But, if possible, try to get your experiments into the
call for papers so no one gets surprised.
</li>
<li> Do not hesitate to contact any or all of the steering
commitee members with any questions you might have.</li>
